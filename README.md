# Cognitive Biases Shield - ADR
This repository provides an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) template designed to mitigate the effects of cognitive biases in decision-making processes. By structuring and documenting architectural decisions, we aim to promote clearer thinking, better understanding, and more informed choices in software development

# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

An **ADR** is a document for a single software architecture decision, which has two main objectives:

1. **Construct an Architecture Decision Log (ADL)**:
   A repository of decisions made throughout the lifespan of a project. Such a repository can be instrumental in understanding how the architecture has evolved.

2. **Guide Towards the Optimal Architectural Decision**:
   An ADR should assist in reaching the most well-informed architectural decision, leveraging the best knowledge and experience available to the team at the time of drafting.

# Why Use ADR

Making the right decision in a dynamic environment like IT projects is a significant challenge. A well-organized decision-making process, especially one that mitigates cognitive biases, serves as a shield protecting us from the consequences of poor choices.

So, what are we exposed to when making decisions in software projects?

Particularly, in IT projects, we're frequently vulnerable to biases arising from our cognition and, notably, from our intuitive system. These can manifest the following phenomena and heuristics:

- **[Attribute Substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution)** 
- **[Availability Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)** 
- **[Affect Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic)**
- **[Priming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology))** 
- **[Framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology))** 
- **[Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)** 
- **[Planning Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy)**

Teams using this [template](./cognitive-biases-shield-ADR-template.md) and the instructions within are less susceptible to the above errors. Consequently, they have a better chance of making the right architectural decisions.
